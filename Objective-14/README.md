# Objective 14: Buy a Hat
**Location: Burning Ring of Fire / Hat Vending Machine**  
**Hints (3x) from Wombley Cube**

This objective is about getting familiar with transactions on a blockchain.
In this example we buy a hat from the hat vending machine and pay with KringleCoins.

We select a sailor hat. The machine tell us to pre-approve the transfer of 10 KC at a KTM to the wallet address 0x7Ec47B5ca7E6230377590F02ACCDD02DB98AB1aD.

After having done this, the hat vending machine confirms the transaction and provides the hat to us.

```
Transaction succeeded!
