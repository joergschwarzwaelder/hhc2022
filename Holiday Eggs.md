# Holiday Eggs

### Jason
This year Jason is the dead canary in the underground.
We can pull the handle in the birdcage and it make a flush noise (reference to last year where Jason was a toilet flush handle).

### Shenanigans
There is again a Shenanigans area (Terry Pratchett discworld themed). The entrance is on the left side of the castle.
In this area is also the Santa Magic terminal to recover the private key of the wallet in case is got lost.

### Snowrog
When you pass through the Tolkien Ring area all the way to the right you stop at an ice bridge.
A little bit more to the right (unreachable) where is an invisible Snowrog. You can talk to it by tampering with the web socket (talk to `snowrog`).

### Levitation
At two positions in the Web Ring area it is possible to levitate.
